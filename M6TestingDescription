For this milestone, we decide to test the implementation of the win screen as if it run correctly. We test 
if the win screen appears when the player successfully defenses the monument. We test this function in three 
different modes. We added the ability to update the towers to different tower only when the player has enough 
time (there is a specific time limit for each difficulty). We test this functionality to make sure the implement
run without any error or delay, and the money is reduced currently when the tower updated. We implement the final 
boss to be the strongest. The damage of the final boss is also very effective to towers. This is the core implement 
of this milestone for our team. So that we test if the final boss appears on three different modes with different stats. 
We also implement and test to see if the monument health is 1000 when enemies are defeated
